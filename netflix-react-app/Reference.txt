  * Folder Names* - PascalCase 
  * Event Handlers - camelCase 
      Should have handle prefix or Handler Suffix 
      handleAddToFav() or else addToFavHandler()
  * Never use snake_case

Routing in ReactJS 
--
  Step 0: 
    npm i react-router-dom

  Step 1: 
    Identifying the URLs and the Menu Items 

    Home              => localhost:3000/
    HOC Demo          => localhost:3000/hoc-demo
    Unit Testing Demo => localhost:3000/unit-testing 
    Hooks Demo        => localhost:3000/hooks
    Context API Demo  => localhost:3000/context-api-demo
    Styled Comp Demo  => localhost:3000/styled-comp-demo

  Step 2: 
    Let's setup the menu with proper URLs  in Menu Component 

  Step 3: 
    LEt's create components for the urls 

  Step 4: 
    Setting up routes in App comp (a.k.a) config the routes 
    Let's put the whole app under BrowserRouter of react-router-dom 

  Step 5: 
    Check the app. Pages will still refresh. Let's fix it 
    Replace a href with Link to 

TODO: Active menu should be set [TODO]
TODO: Page Title should be changed [TODO]

Static Type Checking 
==========

1. Strictly typed lang
    Ex: Java, C#, TypeScript (JS + Datatyping)

    Syntax: 
      // Static Typing 
      var myName: string = 'John';
      myName = 'Steve'; 
      myName = 100; // error 

2. Loosely-typed Lang 
    Ex: JS, PHP, Python 

    Primitive DataTypes: string, number, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, big int 

    Syntax: 
      // Dynamically typed 
      var myName ='John'; 
      myName = 'Steve'; 
      myName = 100; 
      myName = true; 
      myName = [];
      myName = {};
      myName = function(){
      } 

===
 
    
Static Type Checking 
--
  React + TypeScript 
  React + PropTypes 
  React + FlowJS  [NOT RECOMMENDED]
  


TS / Flow 
--
  function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
  add(10, 20);

    1. Manual efforts 
    2. QA team has real requirments 
    3. dev team is not dveloping against the real req 


Modern Software Dev Methodology 
=======
  Devs Prepare Test Cases / Test Specs for Add Feature (REQUIREMENTS)
  --- 
    1. inputs should be numbers 
    2. output should also be a number 
    3. other than numbers are entered as input, add button should be disabled 

  Dev Begins for Add Feature
  ---
    function add(a: number, b: number): number{
      return a + b;
    }

    add(10, 20); // 30
    

  Test Begins for Add Feature
  ---
    add(10, 20); // 30
    add("10", 20); // bug
    add("ABC", "XYZ"); // bug
    add(undefined, true); // bug

Automated Testing
============
  0. Static-Type Checking (TypeScript, FlowJS, PropTypes )
  
  1. Unit Testing 
      * Testing small unit of a component 
      * Individual units / components are tested in isolation 
      * Bug Reduction Density => 40 - 80% 

      Tools: JEST (Test Runner and Framework) + React Testing Library (Testing Utility), Jasmine JS (Framework) + Karma (Test Runner)

  2. Integration Testing 
      * Different units, modules, components are tested as combined entity 
      * behavior of the app would be tested 
      * to expose issues in integration between units / components / modules 
      * Usually done with mounting or rendering a component
      * examples: test if a child comp can update parent comp 

      Tools: JEST + React Testing Library or JEST + EnzymeJS (jquery like tool - dom querying)

  3. End to End / E2E / Functional Testing 
      * Testing the whole app 
      * Usually a multi-step test 
      * Tests are done in simulated browser, there may or may not any UI. 

      Tools: CypressJS, Protractor, Selenium


Approach 
====
  devs write test cases => devs write functionality => (TOOLS) => Instant Feedback of SUCCESS / FAILURE 

  1. Test Driven Development (TDD) 
      * TDD is a programming practice that instructs devs to write new code only if the automated test fails 
      Write Test Case => (INSTANT FEEDBACK OF FAILURE/Bug) => Write Functionality => (INSTANT FEEDBACK OF SUCCESS) => [CODE COMPLETE]

      Tools: JEST, Mocha + Chai 


  2. Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
      * BDD, in which an app is documented, designed around the behaviour the end user expects to experience. 

      Write Test Case => (INSTANT FEEDBACK OF FAILURE/Bug) => Write Functionality => (INSTANT FEEDBACK OF SUCCESS) => [CODE COMPLETE]

      Tools: JasmineJS  
  

Testing Pattern: 
---
  AAA -- Arrange, Act, Assert 

// Where to write test cases? 
// How to Write test cases?
// How to test our app using tools against the test cases?

Context API - Steps 
---
  Let's share the data across comp 

  1. Create context with any data or null 
      createContext()

  2. Provide the data to the whole app -- it is called as app wide data 
      Using  
      <Context.Provider value={ }>
        <App />
      </Context.Provider>
      
  3. Consume the context data in your comps 
      useContext();
